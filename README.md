## Executive Summary

Mercury Agent is a comprehensive neuro-symbolic AI for multi-domain anomaly detection. Its cognitive layer is wired at runtime by the `CognitiveOrchestrator` over ten components — a knowledge graph, multi-hop reasoner and uncertainty quantifier (always on) plus plasticity, causal discovery, IPB, case-based reasoning, indicator development, curiosity and enhanced anomaly detection (optional). The "7-phase evolution" described below is the historical build spine, not a runtime pipeline. The system combines neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning to produce explainable, ethically-bounded decisions across security, medical, environmental, humanitarian, and infrastructure domains.

The framework embodies a **Civilization-First** mission: serving the broad range of scientific, clinical, engineering, humanitarian and public-safety work that hazard detection touches. FINDΩYOU™ — locating the lost, missing and abducted — is one deployment of that mission, not its ceiling. Every public decision surface clears one mandatory, fail-closed **harm-uplift gate** (`cognitive/decision_gate.py`, [`docs/HARM_POLICY.md`](docs/HARM_POLICY.md)), which refuses operational uplift toward a weapon or mass-casualty outcome and permits the diagnostic, defensive, clinical and responsive half of every hazard domain. Benevolence is scored and logged as an **advisory** signal; it is not a pass-bar.

Beyond the library and CLI, the repository ships an **opt-in self-service platform** for operating the detection API as a hosted service — account registration with email verification, TOTP two-factor, API keys with per-account quotas, a dependency-free browser dashboard, an operator CLI, and a TLS compose overlay — all off by default and documented under [Self-Service Account Platform](#quick-start) and [docs/PLATFORM_HARDENING.md](docs/PLATFORM_HARDENING.md).

> **Project Philosophy:** Mercury Agent represents the next evolution in AI systems - one that combines the pattern recognition power of neural networks with the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of symbolic AI. This neuro-symbolic fusion enables the system to not only detect anomalies but explain why they matter and what actions should be taken.
>
> **Security Disclosure:** This is a research-grade implementation. Production use REQUIRES:
> - Independent security review by qualified professionals
> - Validation on domain-specific real-world datasets (MIMIC-III, NSL-KDD)
> - Clinical validation for any medical applications
> - Post-quantum cryptography for Mercury Agent and FINDΩYOU™ is derived from [AMA Cryptography](https://github.com/Steel-SecAdv-LLC/AMA-Cryptography)
> - FINDΩYOU™ is a separate, near-future sibling platform whose humanitarian scope — locating the lost, missing, and abducted to reunite families and help bring perpetrators to justice — is served by Mercury under its Civilization-First mission.

The full result file lives at [`benchmarks/mercury_benchmark_results.json`](benchmarks/mercury_benchmark_results.json).
Methodology is documented in [`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).
A multi-panel visual summary appears in the [Current Benchmarks and Visual Proof](#current-benchmarks-and-visual-proof) section below.

| Metric | Current | Previous | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mean ROC-AUC | 0.8265 | 0.8251 | +0.0014 |
| Median ROC-AUC | 0.8729 | 0.8747 | -0.0018 |
| Mean Oracle F1 | 0.6122 | 0.5998 | +0.0125 |

Regression gates: ROC-AUC must stay ≥ 0.75 and Mean Oracle F1 ≥ 0.55 (the coarse floors set in `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`, held ~9% below the current headline AUC/F1 so they do not flap on normal load-availability variance). Fine-grained, tight regression protection is the deterministic per-dataset guard (`anomaly_regression_guard.py`), not these coarse floors. CI fails the workflow if either drops below threshold.
<!-- BENCHMARK:END -->

**Comparability note.** The aggregate ROC-AUC above blends two evaluation regimes. Only externally-labeled datasets — ADBench and the standard labeled sets, where labels come from a source independent of the scored signal — are comparable to published baselines; the comparable headline is **ADBench Mean AUC 0.8251**. Several environmental loaders are self-labeled by thresholding the signal they score, which inflates their AUC toward 1.0 (label leakage) and is reported for pipeline transparency only. See *Label provenance and comparability* in the benchmarks below for the full split.

**Fusion-hardening (transductive).** The unsupervised fusion changes in `detectors/statistical.py` are measured independently of the headline run by a committed, re-runnable 18-set real-ADBench transductive harness ([`research/omni_equation/harness_adbench.py`](research/omni_equation/harness_adbench.py)): Mean AUROC **0.7397 → 0.7634 (+2.37 pts, 14 W / 2 tie / 2 L)** from base `e118e1f` to the hardened detector (full per-set results in [`research/omni_equation/adbench_results.json`](research/omni_equation/adbench_results.json)). Real data only — the harness fails loudly rather than substituting synthetic. Re-run: `python research/omni_equation/harness_adbench.py`.

<summary><strong>Codebase Scale (measured, not estimated)</strong></summary>

These numbers are produced by `scripts/measure_codebase_scale.py` and gated in CI: `--check README.md` fails the build if the block below drifts from what is on disk, and `--update README.md` regenerates it.  They reflect what is actually on disk, not what marketing copy assumes.

<!-- SCALE:START -->

| Measurement | Value |
|---|---|
| Python source files in `src/omni_mercury_engine/` | **778** |
| Source lines of code (LOC) | **~411,000** |
| Top-level subpackages (true Python packages with `__init__.py`) | **49** |
| Files importing PyTorch (optional `[ml]` extra) | **175** |

**The neuro-symbolic claim is real, not naming theatre.**  Concrete evidence in-repo:

* `src/omni_mercury_engine/cognitive/` — ~32,000 LOC, 30 modules (excluding `__init__.py`; measured at v2.1.x), including `neural_memory_layer.py`, `symbolic_logic_layer.py`, `neurosymbolic_fusion.py`, `differentiable_logic.py` (with `NeuralPredicateEncoder`, `DifferentiableRuleModule`, `NeuralTheoremProver`, `CounterfactualReasoner` — all real `nn.Module` subclasses), `cognitive_evolution_engine.py`, `chain_of_thought.py`, `multi_hop_reasoner.py`, `causal_discovery.py`, `case_based_reasoning.py`, `predictive_coding.py`, `formal_verification.py`, `knowledge_graph.py`, `multi_agent_coordination.py`, `reflexion.py`, `plasticity_engine.py`, `hierarchical_planning.py`, `ipb_engine.py`.
* `src/omni_mercury_engine/core/neurosymbolic_hub.py` — 1,446 LOC; defines `KnowledgeGraph`, `NeuralEncoder`, `SymbolicRule`, `NeuroSymbolicHub`, `ExplainableOutput`, `FusionMode`.
* PyTorch is the engine of the ML / neuro-symbolic stack, shipped as the **optional `[ml]` extra** (`torch>=2.2.0`, `torchvision>=0.17.0`, `pytorch-lightning>=2.0.0`) — it is **not** a core install dependency: the top-level `import omni_mercury_engine` and the default (non-ML) detection path import without torch, while the ML / neuro-symbolic submodules import `torch` at module scope and require the `[ml]` extra. The measured count of torch-importing files and `nn.Module` subclasses is in the table above. Install the full neuro-symbolic path with `pip install mercury-agent[ml]`.

Mercury Agent is a **neuro-symbolic AI** that exposes anomaly detection as one of its capabilities — it is not "an anomaly detection library that happens to use neural networks."

The claim is **operational, not just architectural**: the production fusion trainer (`OmniMercuryEngine.fit_fusion`) co-trains a differentiable Logic Tensor Network *with* the neural network **by default** (`symbolic_weight="adaptive"`) — a symbolic satisfaction term enters the loss and its gradient flows into the network's anomaly head. The weight follows a label-scarcity schedule that cleared a pre-registered *dominance* bar on real ADBench labels (no full-data AUC regression beyond noise; a seed-agreed low-data lift) and decays to the purely-neural path when labels are abundant. This is co-training in the loss, not a post-hoc score blend. Full accounting, ablation, and the evidence-based keep/quarantine verdicts: `docs/NEUROSYMBOLIC.md`.

<summary><strong>7-Phase Neuro-Symbolic Evolution</strong></summary>

Mercury Agent implements a 7-phase cognitive architecture that progressively builds from basic neural memory to curiosity-driven exploration. Each phase names a real, CI-gated module in `src/omni_mercury_engine/cognitive/` (the "Neuro-Symbolic Tests" required check enforces them):

| Phase | Component | Description | Key Features |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Phase 1** | Neural Memory Layer | Memory embeddings and pattern detection | K-means clustering, episodic/semantic memory, pattern recognition |
| **Phase 2** | Symbolic Logic Layer | NetworkX-based logic graphs | Explainable decisions, threshold rules, inference chains |
| **Phase 3** | Neuro-Symbolic Fusion | Hybrid anomaly scoring | Attention-based fusion, confidence weighting, neural-symbolic integration |
| **Phase 4** | Enhanced Anomaly Detection | Memory knowledge graph | Bayesian predictor, HMM predictor, external data integration |
| **Phase 5** | Autonomous Agent | OODA loop implementation | Observe-Orient-Decide-Act-Reflect, user synchronization, Mercury/AMA Disconnect |
| **Phase 6** | Ethical Bounding | Harm-uplift gate (enforced); benevolence scoring (advisory) | Harm reduction, equity calculation (Gini), empathy module |
| **Phase 7** | Cognitive Evolution Engine | Curiosity-driven exploration | `CuriosityEngine`: measured novelty scoring (online diagonal-Mahalanobis distance) of detected anomalies, wired into the `CognitiveOrchestrator`. The earlier self-play / genetic-mutation / theory-of-mind internals were measured decorative and removed. |

The seven phases are the historical evolution spine, not the whole cognitive
layer: `cognitive/` has since grown to 30 modules, integrated at runtime by the
`CognitiveOrchestrator` (knowledge graph, multi-hop reasoner, and uncertainty
quantifier always on; plasticity, causal discovery, IPB, case-based reasoning,
and indicator development on by default; curiosity and enhanced detection
opt-in — see `cognitive/__init__.py`).

## Current Benchmarks and Visual Proof

<details>
<summary><strong>Detailed benchmarks and methodology</strong></summary>

Snapshot of the committed `mercury_benchmark_results.json` run (2026-06-21). The
[*Latest Benchmark Results*](#latest-benchmark-results) block at the top of this
README is the CI-refreshed current headline; the tables here are the detailed
breakdown. All numbers are measured on real data — no synthetic substitution, no
hyperparameter tuning.

### Methodology and comparability

`MercuryAnomalyDetector` was run untuned over **66 of 75 attempted real-world
datasets** across 12 domains (the 9 failures were unreachable external sources,
tracked by a two-lane reachability harness, `.github/workflows/dataset-reachability.yml`).
Results fall into two regimes, and **only the first is comparable** to published
detectors:

- **Externally-labeled (comparable).** Labels come from a source independent of
  the scored features (ADBench, NSL-KDD, BATADAL, SMD/NAB, CWRU/MSDS). The
  headline is the 47-dataset ADBench result: **Mean AUC 0.8251 / Mean F1 0.5975**.
- **Self-labeled / threshold-derived (not comparable).** Some environmental
  loaders manufacture labels by thresholding a feature they also score, so the
  detector recovers them almost trivially (0.97–1.00 AUC). That is **label
  leakage**, not accuracy — reported below for pipeline transparency only.

The same provenance discipline extends to the live-API loaders: of 20 concrete
loaders, only 2 (`network_security`, `sepsis`) produce labels independent of any
scored feature, and the governed-fusion suite gates self-improvement on those 2
alone. CI enforces the split (`python -m omni_mercury_engine.loaders.label_provenance --check`);
see [docs/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md](docs/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md) for the
governed self-improvement rollout.

### Headline results

**Ensemble** — unsupervised, three-component weighted fusion:

| Component | Weight | Method | Mean AUC | Median AUC |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| ResonanceScore | 40% | FFT harmonic spectral profiles | 0.7665 | 0.8294 |
| KinematicScore | 30% | Physics jerk/curvature via `np.diff` | 0.6009 | 0.6116 |
| InfoGeometryScore | 30% | Fisher-information Mahalanobis OOD | 0.8267 | 0.8760 |
| **Ensemble** | **100%** | **Weighted combination** | **0.8251** | **0.8747** |

| Aggregate (66 successful datasets) | Value |
|------------------------------------|-------|
| Mean AUC / Median AUC | 0.8251 / 0.8747 |
| Std AUC | 0.1638 |
| Mean / Median Oracle F1 | 0.5998 / 0.6747 |

*Oracle F1 is an upper bound (best of a multi-strategy threshold sweep), not
operational performance.*

### Comparable domain results (externally-labeled)

These rows use labels independent of the scored features — the numbers to line up
against other detectors.

| Domain | Datasets | Mean AUC | Mean F1 |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| **ADBench** | 47 | **0.8251** | **0.5975** |
| Industrial (BATADAL) | 1 | 0.9114 | 0.5545 |
| Security (NSL-KDD, ThreatIntel) | 2 | 0.8995 | 0.7423 |
| Space (NASA, Solar) | 2 | 0.8753 | 0.7356 |
| Time Series (SMD, NAB) | 2 | 0.6807 | 0.4333 |
| General (ADRepository) | 1 | 0.7086 | 0.3468 |
| Academic (CWRU, MSDS)† | 2 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |

*† Academic/General rows are genuinely labeled but tiny; the 1.0000 AUC reflects
easy separability at that size, not headline accuracy. The representative
comparable figure is the 47-dataset ADBench row.*

### Competitive positioning (ADBench, one identical unsupervised protocol)

Against PyOD baselines on the full 57-dataset ADBench suite, Mercury's tier
detector places **3rd of 8 by mean rank (3.79)** — behind `knn` (2.40) and
`local_outlier_factor` (3.69), and **ahead of** `isolation_forest` (3.94),
`hbos` (5.14), `copod` (5.62), and `ecod` (6.11). Mercury is strong-to-dominant
on high-dimensional sets where distance methods collapse, and weaker on
low-dimensional local-density sets. Full method-by-method tables:
[benchmarks/COMPETITIVE_BENCHMARK.md](benchmarks/COMPETITIVE_BENCHMARK.md).

Untuned 5-fold-CV spot check versus standard baselines (regenerated from
license-clean scikit-learn datasets, deterministic at `--seed 42`, via
`python -m benchmarks.empirical_benchmark --readme-subset`):

| Detector | breast_cancer | covtype | digits_8 |
|----------|---------------|---------|----------|
| **Mercury-Agent** | 0.796 | 0.896 | 0.489 |
| One-Class SVM | 0.662 | **0.901** | **0.767** |
| LOF | 0.544 | 0.667 | 0.571 |
| Elliptic Envelope | 0.888 | 0.899 | 0.503 |
| TranAD (supervised SOTA ref) | 0.940 | 0.892 | 0.742 |
| MAAT (supervised SOTA ref) | **0.946** | — | 0.747 |

*AUC; bold = best per column, "—" = not evaluated. Mercury is unsupervised and
untuned; TranAD/MAAT (Tuli et al., VLDB 2022; Kang & Kang, 2023) are supervised
published references marking the ceiling, not re-run here.*

### Calibration and conformal validation

| Validation | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Threshold calibration (MD-011) | 33/52 datasets improved (71.2%), mean F1 +0.097 |
| Fusion-weight CV (MD-003) | adaptive weights within 0.007 F1 of L-BFGS optimal; 82.7% of datasets within 0.02 F1 |
| Conformal coverage (MD-005, CrossConformal @0.90/0.95) | 69.2% empirical (36/52 datasets) |

### Domain-specific hazard benchmarks

Per-domain results from `run_all_benchmarks.py`:

| Domain | Mean AUC | Domain | Mean AUC |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Earthquake | 0.9367 | Network Security | 0.7983 |
| Tsunami | 0.8905 | Hurricane | 0.7233 |
| Tornado | 0.8803 | Flood | 0.6837 |
| Pandemic | 0.8588 | FEMA | 0.6573 |
| Energy | 0.8038 | Marine | 0.3540 (gate fail) |

*Wildfire, Volcanic, Landslide, Sepsis, and Financial reported no data in this
run (API key required or upstream unavailable).*

### Transparency: self-labeled loaders (leakage-flagged, not comparable)

Labels here are a deterministic threshold on a scored feature, so high AUC is
leakage, not accuracy. Listed for pipeline transparency only — never averaged
into a headline.

| Domain | Datasets | Mean AUC | Label rule (leaky) |
|--------|----------|----------|--------------------|
| Air Quality (EPA) | 1 | 0.9975 | PM2.5 > 35.4 µg/m³ |
| Climate (NOAA GSOD/StormEvents/ERDDAP) | 3 | 0.9939 | ±3σ threshold |
| Environmental (USGS/NOAA/EPA) | 3 | 0.8856 | ±3σ threshold |
| Ocean (NOAA Buoy) | 1 | 0.8510 | ±3σ threshold |
| Disaster (FEMA) | 1 | 0.9993 | threshold/polarity-derived |

### When to use Mercury

**Use Mercury when** anomaly decisions must be interpretable, data types are
diverse and need adaptive profiling, or no labeled anomaly data is available.
**Prefer alternatives when** labeled data exists (use a supervised classifier) or
memory is tightly constrained. Caveats, stated plainly: KinematicScore is
near-random on shuffled tabular data (mean AUC 0.60); 6 datasets fall below 0.50
AUC (ensemble inversion on high-dimensional data); no tuning was performed.

### Visual proof

The benchmark panels below are generated from the current committed
`mercury_benchmark_results.json` run (2026-06-21; Mean AUC 0.8251 over 66
successful datasets) by `benchmarks/generate_benchmark_visuals.py`; the
calibration panel comes from the MD-011/MD-005 calibration-validation run
(52 datasets).

## 3R: Recursion-Resonance-Refactoring

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand 3R Mathematical Framework</strong></summary>

The **3R mechanism** (Recursion-Resonance-Refactoring) is a mathematical method for anomaly detection and optimization that forms the core of Mercury Agent's detection capabilities. This framework combines three complementary engines for pattern recognition and adaptive learning.

### Recursion Engine

The Recursion Engine implements hierarchical multi-scale pattern analysis through recursive feature extraction:

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
R(x, d) = f(x) + α · R(g(x), d-1)  for d > 0
R(x, 0) = f(x)
```

Where `f(x)` is the feature extraction function, `g(x)` is the downsampling operator, `α` is the decay factor, and `d` is the recursion depth.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Multi-scale hierarchical pattern detection across temporal and spatial dimensions
- Recursive feature extraction that captures both local and global anomaly signatures
- Self-similar pattern recognition inspired by fractal mathematics
- Adaptive depth adjustment based on data complexity

### Resonance Engine

The Resonance Engine performs FFT-based frequency-domain analysis to detect harmonic anomalies and periodic patterns:

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
H(ω) = |FFT(x)|²
A(x) = Σₙ H(n·ω₀) / Σ H(ω)  (Harmonic Ratio)
```

Where `ω₀` is the fundamental frequency and `n` represents harmonic indices.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Frequency-domain anomaly detection using Fast Fourier Transform
- Harmonic analysis for periodic pattern recognition (e.g., Schumann resonance at 7.83 Hz)
- Signal amplification for weak anomaly signatures
- Cross-domain frequency correlation (seismic, electromagnetic, biological)

### Refactoring Engine

The Refactoring Engine provides dynamic optimization and adaptive model refinement:

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
θ_{t+1} = θ_t - η · ∇L(θ_t) + β · (θ_t - θ_{t-1})  (Momentum-based optimization)
L_total = L_detection + λ₁·L_stability + λ₂·L_ethical
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- Dynamic model optimization based on detection performance
- Code complexity metrics for security review and maintainability
- Adaptive threshold adjustment using Bayesian calibration
- Self-healing capabilities inspired by CRISPR mechanisms

### 3R Synergies

The three engines work together to create emergent detection capabilities:

| Synergy | Components | Capability |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **Harmonic Analysis** | Resonance + Recursion | Multi-scale frequency decomposition |
| **Quantum-Inspired Paths** | Recursion + Refactoring | Simulated annealing for optimization |
| **Ava Equation** | All 3R | Unified anomaly scoring: `A = R·H·O` |
| **Asymptotic Horizons** | Resonance + Refactoring | Convergence monitored via a Lyapunov-style decay schedule |

### The Omni-Ava Equation (OAE)

The unified 3R scoring function with ethical gating:

```
A = (w_R·R(x) + w_H·H(ω) + w_O·O(θ)) · η_Ethical^Φ
```

Where:
- `R(x)` = Recursion score (multi-scale hierarchical analysis)
- `H(ω)` = Harmonic/Resonance score (frequency coherence)
- `O(θ)` = Optimization/Refactoring score (adaptive theta)
- `η_Ethical` = Ethical compliance threshold (default 0.96, medical fallback 0.93)
- `Φ` = Golden ratio constant (1.618033988749895)
- Golden-ratio fusion weights (canonical Φ:1:1): `w_R = φ/(φ+2) ≈ 0.447`, `w_H = 1/(φ+2) ≈ 0.276`, `w_O = 1/(φ+2) ≈ 0.276` (sum to 1.0)

**Lyapunov Stability (decay-schedule monitor)**: convergence is *monitored* against the target condition `V̇ ≤ -λV` with rate `λ = 0.25` (`LyapunovConstants.LAMBDA_CONVERGENCE`; distinct from the double-helix adaptation rate `LAMBDA_DECAY = 0.18` — see [Mathematical Foundations](#mathematical-foundations)) — the empirical trajectory is measured against this schedule, not guaranteed a priori.

### 3R Anomaly Transformer (PyTorch)

The `ThreeRAnomalyTransformer` provides a differentiable PyTorch implementation of the 3R mechanism for end-to-end training:

```python
from omni_mercury_engine.ml import ThreeRAnomalyTransformer, LyapunovAnomalyLoss

# Initialize model with domain-specific configuration
model = ThreeRAnomalyTransformer(
    input_dim=25,           # Feature dimension (e.g., NSL-KDD)
    d_model=256,            # Model dimension
    n_heads=8,              # Attention heads
    num_layers=2,           # 3R attention layers
    ethical_threshold=0.96, # Domain-specific (0.93 for medical)
)

# Lyapunov-constrained loss for stable predictions
loss_fn = LyapunovAnomalyLoss(
    mu_stability=0.1,       # Stability constraint weight
    alpha=0.25,             # Convergence rate (matches CONVERGENCE_RATE_PARAMETER)
)

# Training step
output = model(x)  # x: [batch, seq_len, input_dim]
loss = loss_fn(
    x=x,
    x_recon=output["reconstruction"],
    anomaly_scores=output["anomaly_scores"],
    labels=labels,  # Supervised signal for accuracy
)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Golden-ratio OAE weights**: Mathematically grounded fusion (0.447/0.276/0.276)
- **Bounded outputs**: Sigmoid activation ensures anomaly scores in [0, 1]
- **Supervised + unsupervised**: BCE loss with labels + reconstruction loss
- **Lyapunov stability**: Penalizes divergent predictions for safety-critical applications
- **Domain configs**: See `configs/ablation_3r_lyapunov.yaml` for medical/security/infrastructure presets

### Integration with Mercury Agent

The 3R mechanism is integrated throughout Mercury Agent:
- **Detectors**: All 30 detection engines leverage 3R for feature extraction
- **Fusion Network**: Multi-head attention combines 3R outputs across domains
- **Ethical Governance**: Refactoring engine ensures Lyapunov stability constraints
- **Self-Healing**: CRISPR-inspired adaptation uses recursive pattern learning
- **PyTorch Training**: `ThreeRAnomalyTrainer` (Lightning) for end-to-end training with stability constraints

## Key Capabilities

<details>
<summary><strong>Problem Statement and Solution</strong></summary>

### The Problem

Modern anomaly detection faces three critical challenges:

1. **Domain Fragmentation**: Security, medical, environmental, and infrastructure domains require specialized expertise with no unified framework
2. **Ethical Blind Spots**: Most ML systems lack bias detection, fairness metrics, and ethical governance
3. **Production Gaps**: Research models often lack security hardening, input validation, and deployment infrastructure

### The Mercury Agent Solution

Mercury Agent addresses all three challenges through:

- **Unified Framework**: 30 detection engines under a single hybrid fusion architecture covering medical, security, space, infrastructure, and environmental domains
- **Ethical Governance**: Fairlearn bias detection with demographic parity, equalized odds, and 80% rule enforcement; 180+ ethical scalars with Lyapunov stability
- **Production Security**: OWASP-compliant input validation, post-quantum cryptography (Kyber-1024 / ML-KEM-1024, ML-DSA-65, SPHINCS+-SHA2-256f-simple) via AMA Cryptography v4.0.0, JWT authentication, rate limiting

### Target Use Cases

- **Medical & Healthcare**: Sepsis detection, cardiology analysis, pandemic response (requires clinical validation)
- **Security & Intelligence**: Threat detection, intelligence fusion, cyber fortress monitoring
- **Space & Environmental**: Solar storm detection, Schumann resonance analysis, disaster precursors
- **Infrastructure & Humanitarian**: Critical infrastructure monitoring, crisis response, climate resilience

See [Use Cases by Sector](#use-cases-by-sector) for detailed scenarios.

<details>
<summary><strong>Unique Differentiators</strong></summary>

### 3-Layer Defense Architecture

**Defense-in-depth** with 3 independent layers for anomaly detection:

| Layer | Protection | Components |
|-------|------------|------------|
| 1. Core Infrastructure | Security foundation | Kyber-1024 / ML-DSA-65 / SPHINCS+ PQC (AMA Cryptography v4.0.0), JWT auth, OWASP validation |
| 2. ML/AI Pipeline | Detection intelligence | 30 engines, hybrid fusion, multi-head attention |
| 3. Ethical Governance | Fairness assurance | Fairlearn bias audit, 180+ ethical scalars, Lyapunov stability |

### Ethical AI Governance

The signature innovation providing transparent, auditable AI decision-making:

- **Fairlearn Integration**: Demographic parity, equalized odds, 80% rule enforcement
- **180+ Ethical Scalars**: Omnibenevolent constraints across all operations
- **Lyapunov Stability**: decay-schedule monitor of system convergence (measured, not guaranteed)
- **Civilization-First Philosophy**: Humanitarian impact prioritized in all design decisions

### Hybrid Fusion Architecture

Optimized for both accuracy and interpretability:

- **Feature Fusion**: `torch.cat()` across 30 detector outputs
- **Decision Fusion**: Weighted voting with learned importance scores
- **Attention Fusion**: Multi-head attention (4 heads) for cross-domain correlation
- **Final Score**: `0.7 * MLP + 0.3 * weighted_vote` ensemble

### Decision / Abstention / Response Layer (autonomous loop)

Closes the loop from *interpret* to *deter* on top of the calibrated detection
certificate, with an explicit, principled **"don't-know" gate**. On the core
engine it is opt-in via `engine.enable_decision_layer()`; the served deploy
entrypoints — the `/api/v1/detect/flagship` HTTP route, the MCP
`mercury_detect_fusion` tool, and `mercury-agent detect -d fusion` — enable it
by default, so every served flagship detection carries a `decision` section
(additive key; library consumers constructing `OmniMercuryEngine` directly are
unchanged).

- **Calibration-grounded abstention** — reuses the engine-wide `ThreeState`
  contract: the conformal label set is authoritative (singleton → **GROUNDED**;
  `{0,1}` → **UNAVAILABLE**, a *resolvable* don't-know; `{}` → **UNDECIDABLE**, a
  *fail-closed* hold). Neuro-symbolic disagreement, drift, or an ethical-gate
  refusal can only move a verdict toward abstention.
- **Bounded, non-destructive response** — `monitor` / `alert` /
  `recommend_mitigation` / `recommend_conversion` / `recommend_restoration` /
  `escalate_to_human` / `request_input` / `hold`. The loop recommends and
  escalates; it never autonomously executes a destructive action (a test
  invariant enforces this). The restorative *convert* verbs
  (`ResponsePolicy(restorative=True)`, opt-in) recommend non-violent
  convert-to-benign / restore-to-pre-harm paths and are recommend-only by
  construction.
- **Auditable & verifiable** — a deterministic, JSON-safe `DecisionRecord` with
  the calibrated confidence, reasons, caveats and full evidence provenance, plus
  a one-paragraph `explain()` (and a `from_dict` inverse for reload). An
  append-only `DecisionLedger` (bounded ring buffer, **O(1)** incremental
  `summary()`, thread-safe, JSON-`save`/`load`) and a `DecisionLoop` add the
  *verify* step over a stream of decisions. Closes into the existing CAP 1.2
  alerting and autonomy (`AgentAction`) channels.

See `examples/decision_abstention_response_demo.py` and
`docs/capability_vs_vision_matrix.md`.

## Quick Start

<details>
<summary><strong>Installation</strong></summary>

### Standard Installation

Mercury will not import without the AMA Cryptography **native** PQC backend.
`import omni_mercury_engine` runs a fail-closed gate that requires ML-DSA-65,
Kyber-1024 and SPHINCS+ to be loadable from the native C library, and there is
no development-mode or CI-mode escape hatch (`omni_mercury_engine/_pqc_gate.py`).
Neither `pip install -e .` nor `pip install -e ".[all]"` pulls it — it lives in
the `[pqc]` extra and needs a compiled shared object — so the pip step alone
leaves you with a package that raises on import:

> `RuntimeError: AMA/PQC is mandatory for Mercury, but the AMA Cryptography
> Python package is not importable.`

Both steps are required, in this order:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Steel-SecAdv-LLC/Mercury-Agent.git
cd Mercury-Agent

# 1. Python package (core, or ".[all]" for the full ML stack)
pip install -e .

# 2. REQUIRED: build and install the AMA Cryptography native PQC backend.
#    Clones the pinned upstream tag, builds with cmake, installs the Python
#    package, and co-locates the .so so no LD_LIBRARY_PATH is needed.
bash scripts/build_ama_native.sh

# Verify: this must print a version, not raise.
python -c "import omni_mercury_engine as m; print(m.__version__)"
```

Build prerequisites for step 2: GCC >= 12 and the PyPI `cmake>=4.4.0` shim
(the script installs the Python build floors itself). The full procedure,
including the manual out-of-tree variant and the `AMA_REF` / `AMA_REPO`
overrides, is in **[docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md)**.

### Platform-Specific Notes

Every platform needs the AMA build from step 2 above; only the system
prerequisites differ.

**Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+)**:
```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev

pip install -e ".[all]" && bash scripts/build_ama_native.sh
```

**macOS (13+)**:
```bash
# Install via Homebrew if needed
brew install python@3.12

pip install -e ".[all]" && bash scripts/build_ama_native.sh
```

**Windows (10/11)**:
```powershell
# WSL2 required: the AMA native build is a CMake/GCC toolchain build.
wsl --install
# then follow the Linux steps inside the WSL2 shell
```

### Package Naming

The package uses the following naming conventions:

- **Package Name**: `mercury-agent` (used in pip install and pyproject.toml)
- **CLI Command**: `mercury-agent` (the command-line interface)
- **Internal Module**: `omni_mercury_engine` (the Python import path)

You import with `from omni_mercury_engine import ...`. The internal module name preserves backward compatibility with the original codebase while the package and CLI names reflect the current project identity.

**There is no PyPI release.** `pyproject.toml` sets `upload_to_pypi = false`, so
`pip install mercury-agent` does not resolve to this project. Install from a
clone, following **Standard Installation** above — including the AMA native
build, which a wheel could not carry anyway.

### External Dependencies

**DeepFace/dlib (Optional)**:
For biometric features, install DeepFace:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
pip install deepface

# Windows (use pre-built wheel)
pip install https://github.com/z-mahmud22/Dlib_Windows_Python3.x/releases/download/v19.22.99/dlib-19.22.99-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl
pip install deepface
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Basic Usage</strong></summary>

### Simple Example

```python
from omni_mercury_engine import OmniMercuryEngine

# Initialize engine
engine = OmniMercuryEngine(mode="fusion", device="cuda")

# Detect anomalies
result = engine.detect_with_fusion(data)
print(f"Anomaly Score: {result['anomaly_score']:.3f}")
print(f"Is Anomaly: {result['is_anomaly']}")
```

### Extending the engine with additional detectors

The engine starts with five general-purpose base detectors (`statistical`, `temporal`, `spatial`, `dimensional`, `directive`). Other detectors declared in the detector manifest — for example the trajectory `geo_movement` detector or the unsupervised `kmeans_distance` clusterer — are **opt-in**: enable them per engine instance without disturbing the calibrated default fusion path.

```python
from omni_mercury_engine import OmniMercuryEngine
from omni_mercury_engine.detectors import KMeansDistanceDetector

engine = OmniMercuryEngine(mode="fusion")

# Which manifest detectors exist, and which are active on this engine?
engine.available_detectors()            # {"statistical": True, ..., "geo_movement": False}

# Enable a registered detector by name (constructed from the manifest)...
engine.enable_detector("geo_movement")

# ...or register your own BaseDetector instance
engine.register_detector("kmeans", KMeansDistanceDetector(n_clusters=8))
```

Once enabled, a detector contributes its feature group to `fit_fusion` and `detect_with_fusion` like any built-in; one that cannot process a given input is skipped gracefully rather than failing the call. A detector added **after** `fit_fusion` has trained participates only after a re-fit, since fusion inference is restricted to the feature groups training saw.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Shared JWT signing key. Unset in production, `JWTAuth` derives the key via AMA HD Key Management (`api/auth.py`) — deterministic fleet-wide when `AMA_MASTER_SEED` is set, per-process (with a logged warning) otherwise | None |
| `AMA_MASTER_SEED` | Hex AMA HD master seed (`openssl rand -hex 64`); makes HD-derived keys identical across workers/replicas/restarts | unset |
| `MERCURY_CACHE_SECRET` | Shared HMAC-SHA256 secret for Redis cache entry signing (`RedisCache`); tampered entries raise `CacheIntegrityError` | unset |
| `OMNI_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` | Enable API rate limiting (`api/server.py`) | `true` |
| `OMNI_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` | Sustained rate-limit budget | `100` |
| `OMNI_RATE_LIMIT_BURST` | Token-bucket burst size | `20` |
| `MERCURY_ENV` | Environment mode (`development` / `production`; unknown values raise) | `development` |
| `MERCURY_CORS_ORIGINS` | Explicit CORS origin allow-list; in production, unset means same-origin only (CORS middleware disabled) | unset |
| `OMNI_ENSEMBLE_CALIBRATION` | Per-detector ensemble score calibration (`rank`/`ecdf`/`isotonic`/`platt`/`none`); see `docs/DETECTION_MECHANISMS.md` | `rank` |
| `OMNI_ENSEMBLE_WARMUP` | Warm-up window the ensemble calibrators train on (int points / float fraction) | whole training series |
| `OMNI_DETECTOR_NAN_POLICY` | Detector-tier NaN/Inf policy (`neutral`/`impute`/`flag`/`raise`) | `neutral` |
| `OMNI_DETECTOR_MAX_MAGNITUDE` | Unified safe magnitude cap for detector scores/inputs/metadata | `1e100` |
| `OMNI_DETECTOR_RIDGE_FACTOR` | Digital-twin scale-relative Tikhonov ridge factor | `1e-6` |
| `OMNI_DETECTION_CONFIG` | Path to a YAML/JSON file supplying the `OMNI_DETECTOR_*` / `OMNI_ENSEMBLE_*` knobs (env overrides file) | unset |
| `MERCURY_FRONTEND_ENABLED` | Serve the browser account UI from the API process (see [Self-Service Account Platform](#quick-start)) | `false` |
| `MERCURY_KEYSTORE_PATH` | SQLite file backing all account/quota platform state | unset (in-memory) |
| `MERCURY_QUOTA_ENABLED` | Per-account quota enforcement on metered routes | `false` |
| `MERCURY_QUOTA_FAIL_CLOSED` | Deny metered requests with 503 when the quota infrastructure itself fails | `false` |

The account/auth/quota platform adds ~30 more optional `MERCURY_*` variables (sessions, CSRF, SMTP, throttles, tiers, audit trail, at-rest sealing); the authoritative reference table is in [docs/PLATFORM_HARDENING.md](docs/PLATFORM_HARDENING.md#configuration-reference). Unset, every one of them keeps the pre-platform behaviour.

### Volume Mounts

| Mount Point | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `/app/data` | Input data files |
| `/app/models` | Trained model checkpoints |
| `/app/results` | Benchmark and inference results |
| `/app/output` | Output files from batch processing |

This architecture supports scalable deployments via Kubernetes/Helm where the API server handles inference requests while training jobs can be run as separate batch workloads.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Self-Service Account Platform (opt-in)</strong></summary>

The repository ships an account/auth/quota platform for operating the detection
API as a hosted service. It is **additive and opt-in**: the account routes are
inert unless used (state defaults to in-memory, mail to console), quota
enforcement and the browser UI are off until explicitly enabled, and with the
frontend left off every pre-existing route — including the 404 at `/` — stays
byte-identical (pinned by `tests/api/test_frontend.py`).

### What it adds

- **Account API** under `/api/v1/auth` — registration with email verification,
  login with optional TOTP two-factor (QR provisioning + one-time recovery
  codes), password reset, email change, API-key lifecycle with a **one-time
  raw-key reveal**, and `GET /api/v1/auth/usage` reporting current quota
  consumption (authenticated by browser session or `X-API-Key`).
- **Browser UI** (`MERCURY_FRONTEND_ENABLED=true`) — dependency-free static
  pages served by the API process (`/register`, `/login`, `/verify-email`,
  `/reset-password`, `/dashboard` for API keys, 2FA enrolment, and usage).
  No build toolchain, no CDN assets, no inline scripts (CSP-compatible);
  state-changing requests carry a CSRF double-submit token.
- **Quotas and throttles** — per-account request/compute quotas with named
  tiers and per-account overrides (`MERCURY_QUOTA_*`), per-action auth
  throttles, and an optional fail-closed mode
  (`MERCURY_QUOTA_FAIL_CLOSED=true`) that answers 503 instead of allowing
  traffic when the quota infrastructure itself fails.
- **Operator CLI** — `mercury-agent platform account show|list|set-tier|disable|enable`,
  `platform quota override set|clear|show`, `platform usage report`, and the
  read-only `platform audit verify` for the tamper-evident audit chain. The
  CLI never prints secrets.
- **Platform metrics** — Prometheus counters for registrations, login
  outcomes, throttle/quota denials, email delivery, and maintenance sweeps on
  the existing `/metrics` endpoint (`api/platform_metrics.py`; import-guarded,
  a silent no-op without `prometheus_client`).

### Single-host deployment (compose overlay + automatic TLS)

```bash
# API + Caddy auto-TLS reverse proxy (app.mercuryagent.global by default),
# persistent platform state in the mercury-platform-data volume:
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.platform.yml up -d
```

The security posture (raw keys, passwords, session tokens, and TOTP secrets
are never stored or logged — hashes/sealed values only; enumeration-safe
register/reset/resend; parameterized SQL only), the threat model, the full
configuration reference, and the deployment runbook are in
[docs/PLATFORM_HARDENING.md](docs/PLATFORM_HARDENING.md). DNS, mailbox,
DKIM/DMARC, and hosting sizing for the public deployment are in
[docs/DOMAIN_EMAIL_HOSTING_SETUP.md](docs/DOMAIN_EMAIL_HOSTING_SETUP.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Kubernetes/Helm</strong></summary>

```bash
# Install via Helm. The chart declares no subchart dependencies, so this
# needs no `helm dependency build` and no network access to a chart repo.
helm install mercury-agent ./helm/mercury-agent \
  --namespace mercury-agent --create-namespace \
  --set image.tag=latest \
  --set config.secrets.JWT_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --set config.secrets.API_KEY_HASH_SALT="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

# Production values: MERCURY_ENV=production, strict validation, production
# resources/HPA. Supply your own ingress hostname to expose it externally.
helm install mercury-agent ./helm/mercury-agent \
  --namespace mercury-agent --create-namespace \
  -f helm/mercury-agent/values-production.yaml \
  --set config.secrets.JWT_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --set config.secrets.API_KEY_HASH_SALT="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --set api.ingress.enabled=true \
  --set-json 'api.ingress.hosts=[{"host":"api.your-domain.example","paths":[{"path":"/","pathType":"Prefix"}]}]'

# Check deployment status
kubectl get pods -n mercury-agent -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mercury-agent
```

`API_KEY_HASH_SALT` is not optional under the production values: they set
`MERCURY_ENV=production`, and API-key hashing then refuses to fall back to the
built-in default salt.

Raw manifests, if you prefer kustomize to Helm:

```bash
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/production
```

## Reproducible Verification

<details>
<summary><strong>Executable Lyapunov Certificate</strong></summary>

The Lyapunov decay rate `λ` cited throughout this README and `docs/MATH_SPEC.md` is not a prose claim -- it is enforced by an executable certificate.

**Single source of truth.** `configs/lyapunov_canonical.yaml` declares the
canonical linear surrogate `(A, P)` of the fusion-trajectory dynamics and
the claimed rate `λ = 0.25` (certified with a 2× margin against the
larger computed rate; see below).  `LyapunovConstants.LAMBDA_CONVERGENCE`
in `src/omni_mercury_engine/core/centralized_constants.py` is the matching
Python constant; the reconciliation test
`tests/tools/test_lyapunov_reconciliation.py` fails CI the moment they
diverge.

**Mathematical kernel.** `tools/lyapunov_validator.py` implements two
modes:

| Mode | Inputs | Method |
|---|---|---|
| `quadratic` | `(A, P)` matrices, claimed `λ` | Symmetric-definite generalized eigenvalue problem `Q v = μ P v` with `Q = AᵀP + PA`, solved via Cholesky + `numpy.linalg.eigvalsh`.  Certifies `λ* = −μ_max`. |
| `samples` | `[{V, Vdot}, …]`, claimed `λ` | Worst observed ratio `infₛ(−Vdotₛ / Vₛ)`.  Suitable for non-linear `V` and regression gating, not a proof. |

The canonical config certifies `λ = 0.5` and the claim `0.25` is therefore satisfied with a 2× margin (and a 1e-8 tolerance for floating-point round-off).

**CLI.**

```bash
# Certify any Lyapunov YAML (top-level A/P/λ, or a nested `lyapunov:` block).
python -m tools.lyapunov_validator configs/lyapunov_canonical.yaml

# JSON output, suitable for piping into jq / CI annotations.
python -m tools.lyapunov_validator configs/ablation_3r_lyapunov.yaml | jq .
```

Exit codes: `0` certified pass · `1` claim does not hold · `2` config error.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Ablation Runner with Lyapunov Pre-Gate</strong></summary>

`scripts/run_ablation.py` is the canonical entry-point for experiments that must not run unless their Lyapunov claim is provably satisfied.  The pre-gate is non-negotiable.

```bash
# Single-purpose Lyapunov certificate -- gate only.
python scripts/run_ablation.py \
    --config configs/lyapunov_canonical.yaml \
    --out artifacts/lyapunov_check.json \
    --skip-run

# Multi-variant ablation with the certificate carried in a nested `lyapunov:` block.
python scripts/run_ablation.py \
    --config configs/ablation_3r_lyapunov.yaml \
    --out artifacts/ablation_result.json \
    --timeout 1800
```

Exit codes: `0` success · `2` config not found or `--timeout` invalid (no JSON report; absence of the output file is the explicit "no run attempted" signal for pollers) · `3` Lyapunov gate failed, experiment not launched (JSON report **is** written with the failed certificate's `computed_lambda` / `claimed_lambda` so CI dashboards can render the diagnosis) · `4` no `run_command` declared (JSON report written) · `124` `--timeout` exceeded, GNU `timeout(1)` convention (JSON report written with `run_timed_out=true`).  Process-group isolation is enforced via `start_new_session=True` + `os.killpg` so shell-spawned grandchildren are reaped on timeout (POSIX); Windows uses the documented weaker `Popen.terminate()` fallback.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Universal Equation Optimizer & Runtime Equation Profiles</strong></summary>

`tools/equation_optimizer.py` is a reproducible, safety-gated search over the
mathematical surfaces inventoried from [`docs/MATH_SPEC.md`](docs/MATH_SPEC.md).
It **freezes the original equations as an immutable baseline**, searches a
constrained universal candidate family, and only promotes a candidate that
clears *hard* gates — ethical-compliance invariant, output range `[0, 1]`,
contraction `α ≤ 0.999`, and Lyapunov `λ ≥ 1e-6` — emitting versioned artifacts plus
rollback / continuous-revalidation metadata. When no candidate beats the proven
baseline under the gates, the baseline wins under the documented decision rules. Full
operating guide: [`docs/EQUATION_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md`](docs/EQUATION_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md).

```bash
# Run the optimizer; emits the artifact set under --output-dir.
python -m tools.equation_optimizer \
    --math-spec docs/MATH_SPEC.md \
    --output-dir artifacts/equation_optimization

# Governed protocol runner (inventory → freeze → search → gate → ledger).
python scripts/run_equation_research_protocol.py --config configs/equation_research_protocol.yaml

# Compare the frozen baseline against a candidate runtime profile on real data.
python scripts/compare_runtime_equation_profiles.py --seed 3 --n 800 --out artifacts/runtime_equation_compare.json
```

Exit codes: `0` pipeline ok · `1` a hard gate failed after a completed run ·
`2` tool/config/input exception. The winner JSON records every objective
metric, the constraint-detail booleans, and the selected parameters so a
promotion is fully auditable.

**Runtime equation profiles (opt-in serve path).** The optimizer's frozen OAE
surface is also exposed at inference through
`omni_mercury_engine.core.equation_profiles`: `OmniMercuryEngine(...,
equation_profile="baseline_original_v1")` (or a per-call
`detect_with_fusion(..., equation_profile=...)` / `score_fusion(...,
equation_profile=...)`) blends the calibrated neural probability with the
golden-ratio R/H/O equation signal. **`None` (the default) is an exact no-op**,
so the legacy serve/benchmark path is byte-for-byte unchanged; the blend
metadata is surfaced under `result["equation_profile"]`.

Three profiles ship: `baseline_original_v1` and `quiet_horizon_v1` are **frozen**
(fixed `0.70/0.30` split), while `phi_fibring_v1` harmonises the blend with
Mercury's canonical fibring fusion (`core/fibring_fusion.py`) — a golden-ratio
base split (`φ/(1+φ) : 1/(1+φ)` ≈ `0.618 : 0.382`) plus **correlation-aware
decorrelation**: when the equation signal is redundant with the neural score
(`|Pearson r| ≥ 0.85`) the lower-variance stream is shrunk by `1/(1+|r|)` and the
weights renormalise, so a duplicated channel cannot double-count.

Tests: `tests/tools/test_equation_optimizer.py` (pipeline artifacts + CLI smoke),
`tests/core/test_equation_profiles.py` (bounded/distinct profiles, `None`
pass-through, unknown-profile rejection, channel→R/H/O mapping),
`tests/scripts/test_run_equation_research_protocol.py`,
`tests/scripts/test_compare_runtime_equation_profiles.py`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Hardware Benchmark Harness</strong></summary>

`scripts/run_hardware_benchmark.py` produces reproducible performance numbers for the validator pipeline, paired with the environment fingerprint that makes the result scientifically comparable.  Full operating guide: [`docs/HARDWARE_HARNESS.md`](docs/HARDWARE_HARNESS.md).

```bash
python scripts/run_hardware_benchmark.py \
    --config configs/lyapunov_canonical.yaml \
    --iters 2000 --warmup 200 \
    --out artifacts/hwbench.json

# Treat measured throughput as a regression gate:
python scripts/run_hardware_benchmark.py --min-ops-per-sec 1500
```

The JSON report contains the certificate result, the environment fingerprint (Python version, NumPy version, platform, CPU count, CPU affinity, scaling governor), and the timing block (mean / p50 / p95 / p99 / max / total).  Throughput is reported as `samples / total_s` (which equals `1 / mean_s` exactly when `mean_s` is the arithmetic mean of the same samples — `statistics.fmean`, in this harness — up to floating-point rounding).  The harness emits both `total_s` and `ops_per_sec` so the assertable invariant `ops_per_sec == samples / total_s` can be checked directly by downstream tooling without re-deriving the mean; this also keeps the contract stable if the central-tendency estimator is ever swapped for a trimmed or median variant.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Documentation Drift Gate</strong></summary>

`scripts/check_readme_lyapunov.py` blocks any pull request whose `README.md` or `docs/MATH_SPEC.md` documents a numeric λ that disagrees with the **imported** source-of-truth constants.  The gate is plural: it carries a registry with one entry per canonical constant referenced in user-facing docs, currently `λ_lyapunov = LyapunovConstants.LAMBDA_CONVERGENCE` (the fusion-trajectory Lyapunov decay rate) and `λ_decay = omni_mercury_engine.core.double_helix_engine.LAMBDA_DECAY` (the double-helix evolutionary adaptation rate).  Each check imports its canonical at call time (rather than parsing a YAML or constants file with a regex), matches every Greek / LaTeX / English prose form of its symbol, applies anchor-token context filtering so unrelated `λ`s are ignored, and enforces a `min_occurrences` floor so silently deleting every documented mention cannot achieve a vacuous-green pass.

```bash
# Equivalent to the ISO Hardening / Workflow Hardening CI gate.
# Requires ``pip install -e .`` so the importer can resolve numpy
# (which double_helix_engine imports at module load).
python scripts/check_readme_lyapunov.py
```

This gate is the second mandatory checkpoint: changing `LAMBDA_CONVERGENCE` or `LAMBDA_DECAY` requires updating the canonical config, the documentation, and (for `LAMBDA_CONVERGENCE`) the reconciliation test in lock-step.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

> **Note:** Running the full test suite requires dev dependencies. Install with: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`

<details>
<summary><strong>Test Suite</strong></summary>

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run full test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/omni_mercury_engine --cov-report=html

# Run property-based tests
pytest tests/test_property_based.py -v

# Run security scan
bandit -r src/ -f txt
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:
- **13,950 tests collected** (`pytest --collect-only -q`, 2026-07-24, with the
  optional `torch` / `scikit-learn` / `hypothesis` / `fastapi` / `h5py` /
  `plotly` dependencies installed — zero modules skipped at collection) across
  the test modules counted in the CI-gated
  [Codebase Scale](#codebase-scale-measured-not-estimated) block (the exact
  module count is measured from disk, never hand-typed). A minimal install
  collects fewer tests because modules gated behind those optional imports
  skip at collection time.
- **Property-based testing** with Hypothesis for edge case discovery
- **Security scanning** with Bandit integrated in CI/CD
- **Coverage tracking**: the merge gate enforces measured floors
  (CORE ≥ 33 %, FULL ≥ 62 %) on every PR; `pyproject.toml
  [tool.coverage.report] fail_under = 85` is the long-term
  aspirational target.  Coverage is regenerated per release via
  `pytest --cov=src/omni_mercury_engine --cov-report=term`; do not
  assert a percentage from this README — re-measure on the head of
  `main`.

**Notable Test Suites (historical, v1.4.x → v1.6.x):**
- `test_enhanced_anomaly_detection.py`: 38+ tests for enhanced statistical methods, cross-platform hub, ensemble coordination
- `test_cortical_network.py`: 40+ tests for 6-layer cortical architecture
- `test_statistical_real.py`: 30+ tests for Z-score, IQR, adaptive detection
- `test_temporal_real.py`: 26+ tests for time-series pattern detection
- `test_resilience_real.py`: 27+ tests for circuit breaker state machine
- `test_enhanced_geological_detectors.py`: 60+ tests for Landslide/Wildfire/Volcanic with 3R synapses
- `test_optimizers.py`: 50+ tests for SyntheticGradient/DTP/AMAV integration
- `test_mercury_amacrypto.py`: 60+ tests for AMA Cryptography PQC adapter and EWMA timing monitor

**v1.7 development-cycle additions:**
- `tests/security/test_native_jwt.py` + `tests/security/test_native_jwt_ama_routing.py`: 50 tests pinning the native JWT module (HS256/HS384/HS512 byte-equivalence with stdlib, RFC 4231 KAT incl. SHA-384, AMA-routing vs stdlib cross-check, `alg: none` rejection).
- `tests/security/test_cve_2026_6357_regression.py`: regression guard for the pip CVE-2026-6357 floor across every install path in CI.
- `tests/security/test_nist_fips_kat.py`: NIST FIPS 203/204/205 ACVP-Server KAT vectors verified bit-for-bit (ML-DSA-65 deterministic sigGen, ML-KEM-1024 decapsulation, SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s sigGen).
- `tests/tools/test_lyapunov_validator.py` + `tests/tools/test_lyapunov_reconciliation.py`: pin the executable Lyapunov certificate against documentation drift and against `LyapunovConstants.LAMBDA_CONVERGENCE`.
- `tests/scripts/test_check_readme_lyapunov.py` + `tests/scripts/test_run_ablation.py` + `tests/scripts/test_run_hardware_benchmark.py`: lock the ISO Hardening operator-tool surface (drift gate, ablation runner pre-gate, hardware harness throughput math).
- `tests/api/test_server_comprehensive.py::TestLifespanWarmup`: 4 tests pinning the API warmup lifespan (wiring, success path, internal-failure propagation under the fail-fast contract, TestClient lifecycle).
- `tests/datasets/test_unreachable_loaders_{offline,network}.py`: two-lane reachability harness for the 11 watch-listed datasets whose upstream sources are flaky or not currently fetchable (9 failed in the committed benchmark run; NOAA StormEvents and NOAA ERDDAP recovered).
- `tests/validation/test_synthetic_policy_gate.py`: locks the `MERCURY_ALLOW_SYNTHETIC` policy gate across every loader that previously exposed a `use_synthetic` kwarg bypass.

**Test Suite Stabilization (v1.6.0 Patch — historical):**
- Fixed 100+ test failures caused by missing FastAPI dependency, uninitialized federation attributes, and unreachable synthetic data thresholds
- All fixes are minimal and targeted — no unnecessary refactoring

**Ethics Scoring (`test_ai_ethics.py`):**

The legacy heuristic ethics tests use keyword-presence scoring against
stringified action parameters — for example, the compassion check awards
a base 0.55 plus a +0.1 boost when `create_backup` appears in the
serialised params.  The dual hard ethical gate contract (Benevolence
+ σ_Immutable, raising `EthicalConstraintViolationError(check=…)` at
every public detect / analyze / predict surface) is the production
decision-boundary and is exercised by
`tests/ethical/test_hard_enforcement.py`; the keyword tests are
retained for backward compatibility with the v1.x heuristic surface
and should not be read as the operative ethics contract.

lanes) is measured in the CI-gated
[Codebase Scale](#codebase-scale-measured-not-estimated) block.

### CI Matrix

- **Python Versions**: 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 (declared in `pyproject.toml` and exercised by `ci.yml`'s `code-quality` / `core-tests` / `type-checking` matrix).
- **Platforms**: Ubuntu Latest (Linux x86_64).  macOS and Windows are supported as install targets but are not part of the CI matrix (see [Cross-Platform Support](#cross-platform-support)).
- **Coverage floors**: `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD_CORE = 33 %` on the curated core lane, `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD_FULL = 62 %` on the ML lane.  The 85 % figure quoted under [Code Quality Standards](#code-quality-standards) is the aspirational nightly target, not the merge gate; the floors above are the actual blocking thresholds and are documented in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` alongside the measured baseline that justifies them.
- **Required status checks**: `Code Quality`, `Workflow Hardening`, `Type Checking`, `Security Scan`, `Core Tests`, `Neuro-Symbolic Tests`, `Integration Tests`, `Performance Benchmark`, `CI Success` (rollup), `ISO Hardening Success` (rollup), `PQC Production Readiness`.

## Build System

<details>
<summary><strong>Python Package</strong></summary>

```bash
# Build sdist and wheel
python -m build

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Environment Variables** (read by `api/server.py` / `api/auth.py` / `_env.py`):
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - Shared JWT signing key (unset in production, `JWTAuth` derives the key via AMA HD Key Management — deterministic fleet-wide with `AMA_MASTER_SEED` set, per-process with a logged warning otherwise)
- `AMA_MASTER_SEED` - Hex AMA HD master seed (`openssl rand -hex 64`) for deterministic fleet-wide key derivation
- `MERCURY_CACHE_SECRET` - Shared HMAC secret enabling signed Redis cache entries (`RedisCache`)
- `OMNI_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` - Enable rate limiting (default `true`)
- `OMNI_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` / `OMNI_RATE_LIMIT_BURST` - Rate-limit budget (defaults 100 / 20)
- `OMNI_MAX_DATA_POINTS` / `OMNI_MAX_FEATURES` / `OMNI_MAX_STRING_LENGTH` / `OMNI_MAX_NAN_RATIO` / `OMNI_MAX_INF_RATIO` / `OMNI_STRICT_VALIDATION` - Input-validation limits
- `MERCURY_ENV` - Environment mode (`development` default, `production`)
- `MERCURY_CORS_ORIGINS` - Explicit CORS origin allow-list
- `MERCURY_FRONTEND_ENABLED` / `MERCURY_KEYSTORE_PATH` / `MERCURY_QUOTA_*` - Self-service account platform (full reference: [docs/PLATFORM_HARDENING.md](docs/PLATFORM_HARDENING.md#configuration-reference))

<summary><strong>Implementation Languages — what "multi-language" means here</strong></summary>

Mercury is **multi-language in the *implementation* sense** — the term refers to
the programming languages the system is built in, **not** to multilingual natural
language:

| Language | Where | Role |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Python** (3.11–3.14) | `src/omni_mercury_engine/` | Core engine, detectors, fusion, API, ML pipeline — the primary language. |
| **Rust** | `rust_crypto/` (PyO3) | *Optional, opt-in* classical-crypto acceleration (AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, BLAKE3, Argon2id). Absent → explicit, tested Python fallback. |
| **C / C++** | AMA Cryptography native PQC backend (`.github/actions/build-ama-cryptography`, cmake + `g++`) | Compiled native post-quantum backend; **fails closed** when unavailable rather than silently weakening. |

**Natural language is a separate axis — and not a current multi-language claim.**
Mercury's narrative / voice interface operates in **English**. Some knowledge
sources it consumes (ConceptNet, Qwen) are themselves multilingual, but Mercury
does **not** today offer localized multi-natural-language I/O. Multilingual
natural-language support is a **future epic** (tracked in
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md)), explicitly **not** a shipped capability.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Docker</strong></summary>

```bash
# Build runtime image (default target)
docker build -t mercury-agent:latest .

# Build only the builder stage (for CI caching)
docker build --target builder -t mercury-agent:builder .
```

**Docker Stages**:
- `builder`: Build environment with compilation dependencies
- `runtime` (default): Minimal, security-hardened runtime image

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Kubernetes</strong></summary>

- **Helm Charts**: `helm/mercury-agent/`
- **Base Manifests**: `k8s/base/`
- **Environment Overlays**: `k8s/overlays/{development,staging,production,distributed}/`

```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
helm install mercury-agent ./helm/mercury-agent -f values.yaml
```

> **Note:** The Kubernetes, Helm, and monitoring configurations in `k8s/`, `helm/`, and
> `monitoring/` are **reference configurations** for those who wish to deploy Mercury Agent
> in containerized environments. Mercury Agent is research-grade, community-tested software
> that has not been externally audited for production hardening. Review and adapt these
> configurations to your security requirements before deploying.

## Mathematical Foundations

<details>
<summary><strong>Evolution Equation</strong></summary>

The double-helix evolution engine follows:

```
dS/dt = sum_i w_i * term_i(S) - LAMBDA_DECAY * (S - S*)
```

Where:
- `S` is the system state
- `w_i` are term weights (18 terms)
- `LAMBDA_DECAY = 0.18` is the **double-helix adaptation rate** (defined in `src/omni_mercury_engine/core/double_helix_engine.py`); it controls how quickly the evolutionary state pulls back toward `S*` and is intentionally slower than the Lyapunov *convergence* rate `LAMBDA_CONVERGENCE = 0.25` so that fusion-trajectory stabilisation outruns adaptation. The two constants are distinct by design — do not collapse them into a single "λ" in prose.
- `S*` is the equilibrium state

**Note:** Previously labeled "quantum" terms are classical algorithms (simulated annealing, Boltzmann sampling, Hamiltonian projection).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Ethical Constraints</strong></summary>

- **Lyapunov Stability**: For the fusion-trajectory Lyapunov candidate `V(state) = ||state - target||^2`, the certified bound is `V(t) ≤ e^{-λ t}` with `λ = 0.25` (see `docs/MATH_SPEC.md` §2.2 for the proof and `configs/lyapunov_canonical.yaml` for the executable certificate consumed by `tools/lyapunov_validator.py`).
- **σ_Immutable Constraint**: the second mandatory hard gate at every detect / analyze / predict surface. The enforcement boundary runs the trained 256-D scalar network in `omni_mercury_engine.security.sigma_immutable_gate` with decision threshold **0.93** (`SIGMA_IMMUTABLE_DEFAULT_THRESHOLD`, plus the deterministic per-anchor `CRITICAL_ETHICAL_FLOOR` at the same value); the GOSNN quadratic-form gating layer uses a **0.96** default (0.93 medical fallback, `SIGMA_IMMUTABLE_THRESHOLD` env-overridable, clamped to [0.93, 0.99]) — see `core.global_omni_scalar_network`.
- **Bias Detection**: Fairlearn demographic parity, equalized odds, 80% rule.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Fusion Architecture</strong></summary>

- **Feature Fusion**: `torch.cat()` across detector outputs
- **Decision Fusion**: Weighted voting with learned importance
- **Attention Fusion**: Multi-head attention (4 heads)
- **Final Score**: `0.7 * MLP + 0.3 * weighted_vote`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Anomaly Math Arrest (21-Probe Ensemble)</strong></summary>

A mathematically-independent equation ensemble providing transparent,
auditable anomaly detection. Each of the 21 probes detects
a different anomaly geometry using fundamentally different mathematical
frameworks:

1. **AdditiveProbe** — Linear trend / level shifts
2. **HarmonicOscillatorProbe** — Periodicity violations (damped oscillator)
3. **MomentumProbe** — Sudden acceleration (second differences)
4. **VarianceAdaptedProbe** — Volatility anomalies (rolling variance)
5. **EthicalConstrainedProbe** — Boundary violations (percentile envelopes)
6. **CatalanOptimizedProbe** — Autocorrelation breaks (Catalan-constant AR(1))
7. **ExponentialDecayProbe** — Signal degradation (optimal-lambda EWMA)
8. **HelixMultiplicativeProbe** — Multiplicative shocks (log-ratio analysis)
9. **R3RecursionResonanceProbe** — Nonlinear saturation
10. **SVDProjectionProbe** — Dimensional collapse (Hankel SVD)
11. **LyapunovChaosProbe** — Chaos onset (trajectory divergence)
12. **TopologyHomologyProbe** — Symmetry breaks (central differences)
13. **FractalSelfSimilarityProbe** — Scale-invariance loss
14. **ZetaHarmonicProbe** — Phase coherence anomalies
15. **WavePropagationProbe** — Wave equation violations (smoothed Laplacian)
16. **QuantumSuperpositionProbe** — Interference pattern breaks
17. **EnergyMinimizationProbe** — Energy well escapes
18. **QuantumAnnealingProbe** — Thermodynamic outliers (Boltzmann NLL)
19. **BoltzmannCouplingProbe** — Coupling structure breaks
20. **IQRRobustProbe** — Distribution tail anomalies (Tukey fences)
21. **ModifiedZScoreProbe** — Robust location anomalies (MAD-based)

**Fusion**: Scores are combined via Phi-weighted (golden ratio) fusion with
confidence modulation and correlation-aware decorrelation. Domain affinity
maps reorder probe weights for earthquake, tsunami, pandemic, marine,
geomagnetic, and conflict domains.

## Unique Features

<details>
<summary><strong>Federated Learning</strong> - Privacy-Preserving Distributed Detection</summary>

Nodes train locally and exchange only sufficient statistics (13 fitted
attributes), never raw data.

```python
from omni_mercury_engine.federation import FederatedNode, FederatedAggregator

# Each node trains on local data
node = FederatedNode("hospital_A")
node.fit(local_patient_data)
stats = node.export_statistics(epsilon=1.0)  # with differential privacy

# Aggregator combines statistics from multiple nodes
aggregator = FederatedAggregator(min_nodes=2)
aggregator.submit(stats_a)
aggregator.submit(stats_b)
global_detector = aggregator.to_detector(aggregator.aggregate())

# Global detector is ready for inference
result = global_detector.detect(new_data)
```

**Key properties:**
- No external FL frameworks (Flower, PySyft, etc.) — uses Mercury's native math
- Gaussian-mechanism differential privacy with clipping-norm-based sensitivity
- Mathematically exact aggregation for means (MLE) and stds (parallel variance formula)
- Precision-weighted averaging for Fisher information geometry
- Oracle state round-trip serialization via `get_oracle_statistics()` / `from_statistics()`
- 15 tests covering correctness, privacy, serialization, and dimension validation (`tests/test_federation.py`)

<details>
<summary><strong>Ethical AI Governance</strong> - Mathematically-Bound Fairness Constraints</summary>

Mercury Agent pioneers the integration of ethical principles directly into ML operations through mathematically rigorous constraints. Unlike traditional ML systems that treat ethics as policy overlays, Mercury Agent embeds ethical considerations into the detection foundation itself.

**Fairlearn Integration** provides bias detection across all predictions:

| Metric | Description | Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Demographic Parity | Equal positive rates across groups | Ratio >= 0.8 |
| Equalized Odds | Equal TPR/FPR across groups | Difference <= 0.1 |
| 80% Rule | Adverse impact ratio | Ratio >= 0.8 |

**180+ Ethical Scalars** govern system behavior:
- Compassion, empathy, care constraints
- Evidence, truth, verification requirements
- Justice, fairness, accountability bounds
- Altruism, service, protection priorities

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Production Security</strong> - Defense-in-Depth Architecture</summary>

Mercury Agent employs a comprehensive security architecture designed for production deployment:

**Input Validation** (OWASP-compliant):
- SQL injection detection and prevention
- XSS attack pattern matching
- Command injection blocking
- Path traversal prevention

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- JWT tokens with proper expiration
- Signature verification
- Rate limiting (token bucket algorithm)

**Post-Quantum Cryptography (AMA Cryptography v4.0.0):**

> **What the AMA dependency is, and is not.** AMA Cryptography is Mercury's
> **trust substrate** — the thing Mercury's own guarantees rest on — not a
> mission or a marketing claim. Stated exactly:
>
> * It **implements** NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) and FIPS 205
>   (SLH-DSA), and **passes the ACVP-Server known-answer-test vectors
>   bit-for-bit in CI** (`tests/security/test_nist_fips_kat.py`).
> * It has been **internally reviewed (AI-assisted)**. It is **not** CAVP- or
>   CMVP-validated, and it has **not** been independently audited.
> * Constant-time behaviour is **asserted** by the implementation; it has
>   **not** been independently verified.
>
> Passing the published test vectors is evidence the algorithms are implemented
> correctly. It is not certification, and the two are not interchangeable:
> "FIPS-certified" and "NIST-validated" are claims about a formal validation programme Mercury has not entered, and neither phrase may appear anywhere else in this repository (`scripts/doc_lint.py` fails CI on them). <!-- doc-lint: allow -->

- **Kyber-1024 / ML-KEM-1024** key encapsulation (NIST Level 5, exposed as `KyberKeyPair(algorithm="Kyber1024")` in `src/omni_mercury_engine/security/pqc_backends.py`).
- **ML-DSA-65** lattice signatures (FIPS 204 name for the Dilithium-3 parameter set; supports the §5.2 context-aware sign API from AMA v3.1.0+).
- **SPHINCS+-SHA2-256f-simple** hash-based signatures plus the FIPS 205 SLH-DSA parameter family.
- **Unconditionally hard-required at import time (fail-closed):** there is no classical RSA / ECDSA fallback in `pqc_backends.py`, and **no env-var escape hatch**. `src/omni_mercury_engine/_pqc_gate.py` refuses to import the package unless all three AMA algorithms (ML-DSA-65, Kyber-1024, SPHINCS+) load from the native C backend. The `AMA_REQUIRE_REAL_PQC` / legacy `AVA_REQUIRE_REAL_PQC` env vars are retained only as **no-op compatibility diagnostics**; setting them `true`, `false`, or leaving them unset does not change the gate (pinned by `tests/test_pqc_startup_gate.py`). There is no degraded/warning posture — a missing or partial AMA build raises `RuntimeError` at import.

**Rust Cryptographic Module** (`rust_crypto/`) — *optional, opt-in acceleration*:
- AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD encryption, BLAKE3 hashing, Argon2id
  key derivation, constant-time comparisons (timing-attack resistant).
- **Not built or packaged by default.** The root package builds with setuptools
  and does **not** compile the Rust extension; `mercury_crypto` is absent from a
  standard install. To enable it, build the PyO3 module explicitly:
  `cd rust_crypto && maturin develop`.
- **Explicit Python fallback.** When the Rust extension is absent,
  `omni_mercury_engine.crypto` transparently falls back to the `cryptography`
  package / `hashlib` (and the `blake3` wheel if present), logging the choice at
  import. `crypto.get_crypto_backend()` reports the active backend
  (`"rust"` / `"python-cryptography"` / `"hashlib-only"`) and
  `crypto.is_rust_available()` is the boolean probe.
- **Speedup is measured, not asserted.** Run
  `python -m benchmarks.crypto_backend_benchmark` to measure Rust-vs-Python on
  your hardware; it writes `artifacts/crypto_backend_benchmark.json` with the
  active backend, per-primitive timings, and the observed speedup (or records
  that Rust is unavailable, so no figure is fabricated).

<summary><strong>Multi-Domain Detection</strong> - 30 Specialized Engines</summary>

Mercury Agent transcends single-domain limitations by providing specialized detection engines across multiple domains:

| Domain | Engines | Capabilities |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Medical | 4 | Sepsis, cardiology, neurocritical, pandemic |
| Security | 4 | Threat, intelligence, cyber, traffic |
| Space | 4 | Solar flare (Kp/NOAA G-scale physics), Schumann, cosmic ray, meteor (Bayesian) |
| Infrastructure | 4 | CISA, crisis, climate, economic |
| Environmental | 6 | Tsunami (FFT), earthquake (P/S-wave), landslide (SVM/RF), wildfire (CNN/NDVI), volcanic (HMM), disaster |
| Statistical | 8 | MAD, LOF, DBSCAN, MCD, Grubbs, CUSUM, GESD, Dynamic Threshold |

**Enhanced Geological Detectors:**
- **Landslide**: SVM/RF classifiers with temporal lags, 3R Recursion synapse for multi-scale analysis
- **Wildfire**: CNN with NDVI satellite processing, 3R Resonance synapse for smoke pattern detection
- **Volcanic**: HMM state transitions (quiescent→unrest→eruption), 3R Refactoring synapse for adaptive θ

All engines share a common fusion architecture with 128D normalization enabling cross-domain correlation and unified anomaly scoring.

<summary><strong>GOSNN Global Omni-Scalar Network</strong> - Synaptic Intelligence Hub</summary>

The **GlobalOmniScalarNetwork (GOSNN)** is the intelligence fusion hub. It registers ~209 omni-scalars across 8 major categories; **127 of them are *operational*** and drive the σ_Immutable gate, while the remaining 82 are diagnostic measurement scalars (descriptions of code / system under analysis) registered for discoverability and reporting but filtered out of the gate's input vector by `GlobalOmniScalarNetwork._is_metric_only_scalar`.

**Scalar Categories (~209 registered / 127 operational):**
- **ETHICAL (~27)**: Core ethical values and Civilization-First principles (all operational)
- **COSMIC (~7)**: Universe-scale harmony and telos alignment (all operational)
- **QUANTUM_CONSCIOUSNESS (~7)**: Quantum-inspired processing (all operational)
- **HUMANITARIAN (~9)**: Crisis response and human welfare (all operational)
- **SECURITY (~6)**: Threat detection and cyber defense (all operational)
- **SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING (~127 = 45 operational + 82 diagnostic)**: Code quality, optimization, 3R synergy (operational); plus ISO/IEC 25010 product quality, Halstead, McCabe + cognitive (SonarQube), Maintainability Index variants, NIST SAMATE assurance, DORA delivery, SLSA supply-chain, OpenSSF Scorecard, ISO/IEC 5055 (CISQ), NIST SSDF (SP 800-218) practices (diagnostic measurement)
- **MEDICAL (~10)**: Healthcare and diagnostic support (all operational)
- **ADVANCED_REASONING (~16)**: Logic, inference, knowledge synthesis (all operational)

**Key Features:**
- **Hard Ethical Gate (Wave B, PR #179)**: σ_Immutable is the **second mandatory hard gate** at every public detect / analyze / predict surface, running after the Benevolence gate. A score below threshold raises `EthicalConstraintViolationError(check="sigma_immutable")`; if GOSNN itself cannot run, the boundary raises `EthicalConstraintViolationError(check="gosnn_unavailable")`. There is no advisory mode and no public flag that disables either gate (test-only bypass requires the auditable module-level `omni_mercury_engine.engine._GOSNN_TESTING_BYPASS` flag).
- **32-Head Triadic φ-Weighting**: Multi-head attention with golden ratio optimization
- **Harmonic Synergy**: Bidirectional synapse connections to 3R mechanism
- **Single source of truth for σ layout**: `SIGMA_IMMUTABLE_DIM=256`, `SIGMA_ETHICAL_BAND_END=27`, `SIGMA_USED_BAND_END=180` exported from `omni_mercury_engine.security.sigma_immutable_gate`.

**Bidirectional Synapses:**
- Detectors → GOSNN ethical gate ↔ 3R adaptive O(θ)
- Enhanced detectors register scalars with `omni_` prefix
- **No silent GOSNN fallback**: a GOSNN failure now raises `check="gosnn_unavailable"` and aborts the call (Wave B fail-closed contract). The previous `gosnn_metadata.fallback_mode=True` path has been removed.

<summary><strong>AMA Cryptography Integration</strong> - Post-Quantum Cryptography Adapter</summary>

The **AMA Cryptography adapter** provides post-quantum cryptographic security with GOSNN synapse integration:

**PQC Algorithms** (sourced from AMA Cryptography v4.0.0):
- **ML-KEM-1024 / Kyber-1024**: Post-quantum key encapsulation, FIPS 203, NIST Level 5
- **ML-DSA-65 (Dilithium-3)**: Post-quantum digital signatures, FIPS 204 §5.2 (context-aware deterministic signing), NIST Level 3 (≈ 192-bit classical security strength)
- **SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s / SHA2-256f**: Hash-based digital signatures, FIPS 205, NIST Level 1 / Level 5 respectively
- **SPHINCS+-SHA2-256f-simple**: Legacy pre-FIPS-205 hash-based signatures, retained for backward compatibility
- **EWMA/MAD Timing Monitor**: <2% overhead crypto-operation anomaly detection

**Correctness evidence (in-repo, measured-and-published):**
- **Known-Answer Tests:** `tests/security/test_ama_kat.py` pins
  Ed25519 RFC 8032 §7.1 vectors bit-for-bit, ML-DSA-65 round-trip,
  Kyber-1024 encaps/decaps round-trip, SPHINCS+ round-trip, and
  ML-DSA deterministic-signing reproducibility. Runs on every PR
  via the `PQC Production Readiness` workflow.
- **NIST FIPS KAT vectors:** `tests/security/test_nist_fips_kat.py`
  verifies bit-for-bit reproducibility against curated NIST ACVP-Server
  test vectors (FIPS 203/204/205): ML-DSA-65 deterministic sigGen,
  ML-KEM-1024 decapsulation, SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s sigGen.
  Source: [usnistgov/ACVP-Server](https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP-Server).
- **Measured coverage:** the `PQC Production Readiness` CI workflow
  publishes pytest-cov coverage for `security/crypto_api.py` +
  `security/pqc_backends.py` + `security/pqc_guards.py` as a CI
  artifact (`pqc-coverage`).  Without the AMA native C library:
  `crypto_api.py` 62%, `pqc_backends.py` 43%, `pqc_guards.py` 24%.
  With AMA native lib installed (CI `verify-real-pqc` job): all PQC
  codepaths are exercised, raising coverage to its measured ceiling.
  Published, not "unaudited" framing.

**Security Features:**
- Attack simulation (timing, replay, side_channel)
- Crypto anomaly recording with severity classification
- GOSNN synapse for security detector integration
- **Unconditional fail-closed enforcement** — Mercury Agent refuses to import
  at all (`RuntimeError` from `_pqc_gate.py`) when AMA Cryptography's native C
  library is not built, regardless of any env var. The `AMA_REQUIRE_REAL_PQC`
  / back-compat `AVA_REQUIRE_REAL_PQC` vars are retained only as no-op
  compatibility diagnostics — there is no degraded "dev mode" and the gate
  cannot be disabled. `PQCProductionWarning` remains a public exception type in
  `security.pqc_guards` for downstream integrators to catch, but the fail-closed
  gate never emits it (the package simply does not import without real AMA).

**Integration:**
```python
from omni_mercury_engine.integrations.mercury_amacrypto import create_ama_cryptography_adapter

adapter = create_ama_cryptography_adapter(gosnn_synapse_enabled=True)
if adapter.is_available():
    keypair = adapter.generate_dilithium_keypair()  # cached on the adapter
    # ``private_key=None`` uses the cached secret_key from above; pass an
    # explicit ``private_key=keypair.secret_key`` if you manage your own
    # key lifecycle.
    signature = adapter.sign_dilithium(message)
```

The lower-level functional surface (no GOSNN coupling, no timing
monitor) lives in `omni_mercury_engine.security.pqc_backends`:
`generate_dilithium_keypair`, `dilithium_sign`, `dilithium_verify`,
`generate_kyber_keypair`, `kyber_encapsulate`, `kyber_decapsulate`,
`generate_sphincs_keypair`, `sphincs_sign`, `sphincs_verify`, and the
FIPS 205 parameter-driven `slhdsa_*` family.  Use the adapter for
operator workflows; use the functional surface for one-shot
cryptography in tests, scripts, and library code.

- **AMA Cryptography**: GNU GPL v3.0 (pinned to `v4.0.0`; the sole PQC backend, and the source of the ACVP-validated native HMAC bindings consumed by `omni_mercury_engine.security.native_jwt`)

PyJWT was retired from the dependency surface in v1.7.0; Mercury now
ships a pure-stdlib JOSE implementation
(`omni_mercury_engine.security.native_jwt`) with constant-time

### Data Source Transparency

Benchmark results include a `data_source` field indicating data provenance:
- `real-github`: Direct from public GitHub repositories
- `real-local`: User-downloaded authentic data
- `real-github-partial`: Partial real data (some machines/channels failed)

> **Note:** The benchmark never fabricates data. When a dataset's real sources
> are unavailable it is **skipped** (recorded as unavailable), never substituted
> with synthetic data — consistent with the deployment-level
> `MERCURY_ALLOW_SYNTHETIC` policy gate (`tests/validation/test_synthetic_policy_gate.py`).

### Configuration

The harness is a runnable CLI (`python -m benchmarks.empirical_benchmark --help`); a run
is deterministic for a fixed `--seed` and dataset snapshot. Dataset fetching can be
configured via environment variables:
- `MERCURY_SMD_MACHINES`: Number of SMD machines to fetch (default: 28, CI: 5)
- `MERCURY_FETCH_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 10)
- `MERCURY_FETCH_DELAY`: Base delay for exponential backoff (default: 2.0 s)

## Legal Disclaimer & Attribution

### Development Model

**Conceptual Architect:** Steel Security Advisors LLC and Andrew E. A. conceived, directed, validated, and supervised the development of Mercury Agent.

**AI Co-Architects:** Significant portions of the codebase, documentation, mathematical frameworks, and technical implementation were constructed by AI systems: Eris ✠, Eden ♱, Devin ⚛︎, and Claude ⊛.

This project represents a human/AI collaborative construct - a development paradigm where human vision, requirements, and critical evaluation guide AI-generated implementation.

### Professional Background Disclosure

The human architect does not hold formal credentials in machine learning or medical diagnostics. The AI contributors, while trained on relevant literature, are tools without professional accountability.

### What We Did Right

- **Standards-based design:** Built on OWASP security guidelines, NIST PQC standards, Fairlearn fairness metrics.
- **Quantified claims:** All performance metrics are measured and documented with methodology; no figure appears in this README without a referenced source.
- **Comprehensive testing:** 13,950 tests collected with the full optional-dependency surface (`pytest --collect-only -q`, 2026-07-24) across the test modules counted in the CI-gated [Codebase Scale](#codebase-scale-measured-not-estimated) block; a minimal install collects fewer because optional-import-gated modules skip. The suite combines unit tests, property-based testing (Hypothesis), KAT vectors (RFC 8032 / NIST ACVP-Server), and load-test SLO assertions (k6 + locust).
- **Executable mathematical certificates:** The Lyapunov decay rate `λ = 0.25` cited throughout the documentation is enforced by `tools/lyapunov_validator.py` (generalized symmetric-definite eigenvalue analysis), the canonical YAML `configs/lyapunov_canonical.yaml`, and the `Docs λ Drift Gate` CI job -- a documentation claim that disagrees with the certificate fails CI rather than going to print.
- **Transparent limitations:** Documentation explicitly distinguishes validated vs. pending claims, and benchmark figures are paired with the dataset, the methodology document, and the date of the run that produced them.
- **Ethical governance:** Fairlearn bias auditing integrated throughout the ML pipeline; σ_Immutable + Benevolence gates are mandatory hard gates at every public detection / analysis / prediction surface (no advisory mode).
- **Academic grounding:** Medical modules reference JAMA Sepsis-3 guidelines, security follows OWASP, post-quantum cryptography is built against AMA Cryptography v4.0.0 (NIST FIPS 203/204/205 KAT vectors verified bit-for-bit).

### What Requires Caution

- **No Independent Audit:** All security and performance analysis is self-assessed. Production deployment requires review by qualified professionals.
- **AI-Generated Code:** May contain subtle implementation errors. All critical paths require independent verification.
- **Domain-Specific Validation:** Core detection is benchmarked on **66 reproducible real datasets** (of 75 attempted; canonical Mean ROC-AUC **0.8251** / Median **0.8747** from the CI-refreshed "Latest Benchmark Results" block; externally-comparable subset ADBench Mean AUC **0.8251**). 9 datasets currently fail to load due to unavailable external sources and are tracked by a two-lane reachability harness (offline + nightly network) as of v1.7.0. The FEMA Disaster loader's previously-flagged inverted-score bug is fixed in v1.7.0 (`FEMADisasterLoader._select_anomaly_polarity`); the committed run reflects the corrected score. Domain-specific modules may require additional validation.
- **Medical Applications:** No clinical validation. Medical modules require validation on real patient data before any deployment.
- **Research Status:** This is a research-grade framework, not a production-ready product.

### Recommendation

Before production use:

- Validate performance on domain-specific real-world datasets (MIMIC-III, NSL-KDD)
- Commission independent security audit by qualified professionals
- Conduct clinical validation for any medical applications
- Deploy with FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ HSM for production secrets
- Test bias detection on representative data for your use case
